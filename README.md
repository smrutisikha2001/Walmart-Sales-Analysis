# Analysis Objectives :-

1. Product Analysis

Identify top-performing product lines.
Analyze product lines requiring improvement.

2.Sales Analysis

Examine sales trends by product category and branch.
Measure the effectiveness of sales strategies.

3. Customer Analysis
Segment customers and analyze purchasing trends.
Assess the profitability of different customer segments.


## Approach To The Project

1. Data Wrangling
* Handle NULL or missing values by setting NOT NULL constraints during table creation.
* Replace missing data where applicable.

2. Feature Engineering
* Add a new column named time_of_day to give insight of sales in the Morning, Afternoon and Evening. This will help answer the question on which part of the day most sales are made.
* Add a new column named day_name that contains the extracted days of the week on which the given transaction took place (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri). This will help answer the question on which week of the day each branch is busiest.
* Add a new column named month_name that contains the extracted months of the year on which the given transaction took place (Jan, Feb, Mar). Help determine which month of the year has the most sales and profit.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Analyze sales, revenue, and customer trends.
* Answer specific business questions to support decision-making.
